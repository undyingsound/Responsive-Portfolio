			<p>When I was young, I wanted to be the next Dave Grohl. I have an ear for music composition and a drive like no other. This propelled
				me into school music programs as well as joining or starting bands with anyone that could play an instrument. Unfortunately,
				I have not yet been indicted into the Music Hall of Fame, but I did become an awesome drummer in the process - it was time to find a new career path. Rockstar
				life seems boring anyway...</p>
			<p>After working every position in the restaurant industry, I started to get into IT in my early 20s. My parents always wanted
				me to get into the field because it is lucrative and it is ever changing. I started off with doing help desk and customer
				service. I found my voice and my desire to help people and solve problems. I quickly climbed the ladder in each position
				and made incredible connections. Even though I was comfortable, there was always a lack of creativity in my roles which
				led to boredom and a desire to get more out of this life. </p>
			<p>I started looking into web devlopment and I quickly realized that this discipline encompasses all the different areas I
				am trying to harness. I have the ability to combine creative solutions to complex problems both visually and logically. I
				am excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
